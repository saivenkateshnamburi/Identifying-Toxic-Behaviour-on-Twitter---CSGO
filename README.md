# Identifying-Toxic-Behaviour-on-Twitter---CSGO
The goal of this project is to detect toxic behaviour on Twitter, with a special focus on accounts that follow the Counter-Strike game brand. Independent studios and start-ups companies can use this data to better understand the networks, posting patterns, and accounts that contribute to the spread of harmful content online.
